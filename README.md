A bridge between YouTube Music and Last.FM.  Powered by

## Limitations
This project works around limitations from YouTube Music in a few ways:
1. **The API does not include a subscription for playback events.**  We pull the
   playback history and backtrack to the last played track, then submit scrobbles for
   each of those tracks.
2. **The History list (on Google's side) does not allow duplicates.**  This means we
   cannot count how many times a song was looped, and causes more problems since...
3. **The API does not include playback timestammps.**  When pulling the history, we
   rely on the last playback ID found as a bookmark.  This is unreliable and has many
   edge cases:
   - We can't tell if a track has been played in a loop with other tracks.  A playlist
     with songs A, B, and C will only show those three tracks no matter how many times
     it's looped.
   - Rolling back to the last played track is Hardâ„¢.  We store the track ID (YouTube
     video slug) of the last track we found and cut the history there.  So if you
     played 500 tracks between now and the last run, if you ended with the same one
     you ended with last time, we'll find zero.
   - Timestamps are impossible and complete guesswork.  Currently we grab the current
     timestamp when running the pull and assume you started the current track at that
     time, then backtrack that through all tracks in history by length.  So if the
     track you played before this one is three minutes long, we'll assume you played
     it three minutes ago.  It's absolutely imperfect and makes tons of assumptions,
     but it's better than submitting them as all played simultaneously.
   - Playback duration is impossible to track.  Most Last.FM scrobblers let you define
     a minimum playback duration, but since we cannot track start/stop times we will
     always assume it was played in full.  Again, very imperfect, but not much we can
     do about it without more API info.

## Overview
The `daemon` module contains a script that runs at a regular interval, pulling
in data for all users in the database that haven't had a run within their
requested interval.  The daemon does this check every minute.  It's recommended
that users not have an interval lower than a few minutes (default is five) to
avoid having the YouTube API get flagged for excessive activity.  The Last.FM
requests are batched, so they shouldn't be affected by the limit.

The `server` module contains a web server written in Flask that generates a web
interface to add/manage users.  The port for the built-in server is `5000`; the
port for the Waitress server used in production is `8080`.

## Getting Started

If you have Docker Compose, simply deploy the stack:
```yml
x-common-env: &common-env
  LASTFM_API: $LASTFM_API       # A valid Last.FM API key
  LASTFM_SECRET: $LASTFM_SECRET # The secret for that key
  LOG_LEVEL: info               # The log level (info is default)
  CONFIG_DIR: /app/config       # The config folder (/app/config is default)
  SECRET_KEY: $DB_SECRET        # The secret key for encrypting sensitive database stuff

services:
  server:
    container_name: ytfm_server
    image: ghcr.io/ndm13/youtube-fm-server:latest
    network_mode: external # something externally accessible
    publish:
      - 8080:8080  # web interface
    environment:
      <<: *common-env
      # any additional environment variables
    volumes:
      - /data/ytfm:/app/config
  daemon:
    container_name: ytfm_daemon
    image: ghcr.io/ndm13/youtube-fm-daemon:latest
    environment: *common-env
    volumes:
      - /data/ytfm:/app/config
```
Open the web interface (exposed on port 8080) to get started!

If you don't have Docker Compose, or wish to develop locally using the Flask server:
1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/ndm13/youtube-fm.git
   ```
2. Ensure the `LASTFM_API` and `LASTFM_SECRET` environment variables contain your API key and secret, respectively.
   You should also set the `SECRET_KEY` now as this will be used to encrypt values in the database.
3. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   $ python -m flask --app server run
    * Serving Flask app 'server'
    * Debug mode: off
   INFO:werkzeug:WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   INFO:werkzeug:Press CTRL+C to quit
   ```
   Navigate to the URL shown to begin setup.
4. To scrape YouTube Music and scrobble the tracks to Last.FM, run the main script:
   ```bash
   $ python -m daemon
   INFO:root:Connecting to core
   INFO:root:Started run, pulling users
   INFO:root:Running update for user <user> (<uuid>)
   INFO:root:Scrobbling 'Everybody Likes You' by Lemon Demon
   INFO:root:Writing ID 4xElp-lYnyE as new last
   ```
   This will run the script for all users whose last run was longer ago than their chosen interval.  The default
   interval is `3000` seconds (every five minutes).  The more often `main.py` runs, the closer the user's individual
   runs will be to their requested interval, but that means more load placed on both the Last.FM and YouTube Music APIs.
   Be wary of rate limits/bans!

P.S: The default log level is `INFO`.  You can change it by setting the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` per the Python
logging spec.

## Future Improvements
There are some definite quality of life improvements to be made, mostly reliant
on external factors:
- [ ] **Wait for YouTube Music API to get better:**

  Either the unofficial version or (hopefully) an official version with the necessary
  features.
- [ ] **An automation to capture cookies:**

  This is the highest bar for casual adoption. Not sure how to solve this, but I know
  there are already extensions that do this for YouTube-DL-type services.  Needs
  investigation, may be able to repurpose an existing extension.
- [ ] **Anything else:**
  
  Code quality (Python isn't my best language) fixes can be submitted as pull
  requests.  New features or bugfixes can be submitted as issues.
